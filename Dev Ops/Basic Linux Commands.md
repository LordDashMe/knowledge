# BASIC LINUX COMMANDS #

#### FOLDER AND FILE PERMISSION SETUP ####
    
* Change mode all with group write.

    ```chmod -R g+w /path```

* Change mode folder permission to drwxr-xr-x, will assign read, write and execute permission to the owner, 
    and just read and execute permission to everyone.

    ```chmod -R 755 = for directories```

* Change mode file permission to -rw-r--r--, also means that files are readable and writeable by the owner of the file 
    and readable by users in the group owner of that file and readable by everyone else.

    ```chmod -R 644 = for files```

* Change owner of the directories/files.

    ```chown -R www-data:www-data /path```

    ```chown <user>:<user> path/file.ext```

* For accurate or automatic set of permission.

    ```find {./path} -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;```

    ```find {./path} -type f -exec chmod -Rf 644 {} \;```

#### FOLDER / FILE COMMANDS ####
    
* File Rename. Its primary purpose is moving files and folders, but it can also rename them, 
    since the act of renaming a file is interpreted by the filesystem as moving it from one name to another.

    ```mv /source/file /path/file```

* File Copy.

    ```cp {-R} source/file path/file (-R is for recursive copy)```

    ```cp source/file /path/file (So far this is for the single copy tested)```

* Folder or File Remove. (This will delete permanently)

    ```rm -rf path/file```

* Change directory view.

    ```cd path/file```

* View file using VIM. (This will need to install the vim)
