Some of you had asked, how to stay updated with changes happening in the programming world.

Here are some links which I look almost daily

## Daily dose

* https://news.ycombinator.com
* https://www.reddit.com/r/programming
* http://techmeme.com 
    - For Technology updates.

## Weekly newsletters
* http://rubyweekly.com

#### Tip: It’s too much information to grasp for one day. So make sure you do glance, but not get too much dwelved in it.
