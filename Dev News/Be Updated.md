Some of you had asked, how to stay updated with changes happening in the programming world.

Here are some links which I look almost daily

### Daily dose
- https://github.com/explore (Shows daily trending GitHub repos, you can opt to receive daily email. This one is I find too useful.)
- https://news.ycombinator.com
- https://www.reddit.com/r/programming
- http://techmeme.com (for Technology updates)

### Weekly newsletters
- http://rubyweekly.com
- http://javascriptweekly.com
- http://reactjsnewsletter.com
- http://nodeweekly.com (If you still believe Node.js is good ;-))

#### Tip: Itâ€™s too much information to grasp for one day. So make sure you do glance, but not get too much dwelved in it.
